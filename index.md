# GU Lost and Found Hub

Welcome to the GU Lost and Found Hub.

This website helps students and staff report lost items, list found items, and reconnect belongings with their owners.

## How it works

- Check the list of found items to see if your lost item is already reported.
- If you lost something, create a new report with clear details.
- If you found something, create a found-item report so the owner can contact you.

## Lost Items

_List here how people should report a lost item. For example, link to a Google Form or describe your process._

- Step 1: Describe the item (color, brand, special marks).
- Step 2: Mention where and when it was last seen.
- Step 3: Leave your contact information (email or phone).

## Found Items
